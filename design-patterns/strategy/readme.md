- What is the Strategy Pattern?
- The Strategy Pattern lets us define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. The strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

- Eg - Payment Processing
- Each payment method is a separate strategy
- The client doesn't need to know how each payment works
- You can easily add new payment methods without changing existing code
